Welcome to my burger app

In this app you can add burgers and eat them.  The burgers are listed in two locations, either eaten or uneaten.
If a burger is uneaten, you can hit the devour button to eat that burger.  Once the burger is eaten however, that burger is eaten forever.

This is done by putting the burgers in an database that stores the burgers name, their id, and their status as eaten or not.
When you eat the burger, it is chosen by id number so that there isn't a case where two burgers of the same name get eaten at the same time.

You can also add burgers by typing the name of the burger and hitting the blue submit button on the bottom.  By doing this, you are
entering a burger into the database, but that burger will always start out as uneaten that way a user can eat it before it's put in
the eaten section
